      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
        knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
        storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
        educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings
        and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks

        Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of
        better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless,
        the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts.

        Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may
        be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural
        populations, lower- and higher-income families.

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">A survey of literature of the research</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge
        and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
        imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began
        to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education
        developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While
        most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into
        account, some studies find the opposite.
